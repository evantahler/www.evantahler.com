When importing a blog post from another website, it is imperative that you follow the following steps

1. Analyze the latest blog post in the project to understand the needed structure.
2. Read all existing blog posts to see what tags are available. Do not create new tags for the blog post.
3. Get the page's content as markdown
4. Use curl to download the page's original HTML and look for images. Ask the user for how many images should be expected.
5. Copy found images to this project and update the markdown to include them in the proper place.
6. Make the original URL canonical via the markdown front-matter
7. Do nto make the blog post "featured"

To download the page content as markdown, use https://markdown.new/ and append the url to scrape at the end, e.g.`https://markdown.new/{URL}` where `{URL}` is the URL to copy.
