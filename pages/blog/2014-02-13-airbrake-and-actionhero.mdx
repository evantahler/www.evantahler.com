If you are using ActionHero version 10x or higher, you can now use the plugin:

[**evantahler/ah-airbrake-plugin**](https://github.com/evantahler/ah-airbrake-plugin)

At [work](http://www.taskrabbit.com) we use [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io) to monitor exceptions in production. It’s a great tool that sends an email when something goes wrong (among other things). Now that we are using [ActionHero](http://www.actionherojs.com) in production, I wanted to integrate airbrake. To do this, I released [version 7.6.5](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/releases/tag/v7.6.5) which adds the ability to create custom error reporters.

ActionHero already worked all requests and tasks within a domain and reported on them, but that reporting was limited to the output of the [winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) logger. Winston has some great plugins, but airbrake was not one of them. Once we had custom error reporting support, I moved the initial winston logger (using api.log) to the new format:

```js
var consoleReporter = function (type, err, extraMessages, severity) {
  for (var i in extraMessages) {
    var line = extraMessages[i];
    api.log(line, severity);
  }
  var lines = err.stack.split(os.EOL);
  for (var i in lines) {
    var line = lines[i];
    api.log("! " + line, severity);
  }
  api.log("*", severity);
};

api.exceptionHandlers.reporters.push(consoleReporter);
```

Felix has made a [great airbrake library for node](https://github.com/felixge/node-airbrake), which is simple to use with ActionHero’s new error reporter:

```js
// in initializers/airbrake.js

var airbrakePrototype = require("airbrake");

exports.airbrake = function (api, next) {
  api.airbrake = {};
  api.airbrake.token = api.config.general.airbrake_token;
  api.airbrake.client = airbrakePrototype.createClient(api.airbrake.token);
  api.airbrake.client.handleExceptions(); // catch global uncaught errors
  // api.airbrake.client.developmentEnvironments = []; // don't report in various NODE_ENVs

  api.airbrake.notifier = function (type, err, extraMessages, severity) {
    api.airbrake.client.notify(err);
  };

  api.airbrake._start = function (api, next) {
    api.exceptionHandlers.reporters.push(api.airbrake.notifier);
    next();
  };

  api.airbrake._stop = function (api, next) {
    next();
  };

  next();
};
```

The last peace of the puzzle was informing airbrake about deployments, and clearing the previous errors. The airbrake package already has support for this, so we just needed to make a grunt task we call on deployment:

```js
// in /guntfile.js

grunt.registerTask(
  "notifyAirbrakeDeploy",
  "tell airbrake we deployed",
  function (message) {
    var done = this.async();
    init(function (api) {
      api.airbrake.client.trackDeployment(function () {
        done();
      });
    });
  }
);
```
