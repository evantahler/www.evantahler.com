A quick update about the nodeSpider project (my first public node.js project!): It is now based on [ActionHero](http://actionherojs.com).

I [announced the nodeSpider](http://blog.evantahler.com/node-spider-writing-a-real-time-messaging-relay-in-nodejs) project here, and it was what first "sold" me on node.js as a framework. Without going into all of the details of the project, I can simply say that what used to be a very hard sync problem in C++ is now easy to do in node. Since I completed [version 1 of the project](https://github.com/evantahler/nodeSpider/tree/04c1b1fff932bd5bcff8dc78e0d0fa9d32f259fb), I have gone on to create actionHero which used many of the ideas from nodeSpider. Now the project has come full-circle and now implements actionHero directly.

This is a significant update, as the syntax of the outputs has been updated to match actionHero, and hopefully this makes the responses more intelligible :D this project will now benefit from the normal bug-fix pipeline of actionHero.

Here’s a new conversation between 2 peers (and the server log it generated) as an example of the updated syntax:

To implement nodeSpider from actionHero, the only significant pice of code replacing the buil-in api.processAction() method with one that would assume an "unknown" action was a "say" command and should do that instead of throwing an error. Conveniently, there is already a method to update/add api methods as part of the actionHero initializer.

Here’s how I did it:

```js
var actionHero = require("actionHero").actionHero;

var params = {};
params.initFunction = function (api, next) {
  // update process action to make all sent strings a "say" by default
  api.processAction = function (api, connection, next) {
    if (api.configData.logRequests) {
      api.log(
        "action @ " +
          connection.remoteIP +
          " | params: " +
          JSON.stringify(connection.params)
      );
    }

    if (connection.error === false) {
      connection.action = connection.params["action"];
      if (api.actions[connection.action] != undefined) {
        api.utils.requiredParamChecker(
          api,
          connection,
          api.actions[connection.action].inputs.required
        );
        if (connection.error == false) {
          process.nextTick(function () {
            api.actions[connection.action].run(api, connection, next);
          });
        } else {
          process.nextTick(function () {
            next(connection, true);
          });
        }
      } else {
        if (connection.action == "" || connection.action == null) {
          connection.action = "say";
        }
        api.socketServer.socketRoomBroadcast(
          api,
          connection,
          connection.lastLine
        );
        process.nextTick(function () {
          next(connection, true);
        });
      }
    } else {
      process.nextTick(function () {
        next(connection, true);
      });
    }
  };

  next();
};

actionHero.start(params, function (api) {
  api.webServer.webApp.close(); // turn off the webserver
  api.log("Boot Sucessful!");
});
```
