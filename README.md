## Install
This is a [React Project](https://facebook.github.io/react/) utilizing [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

- `npm install`

## Running in Development
- `npm run dev`

## Building for Production

This site is deployed automatically to Vercel. 

## Linting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io) to manage our lint rules.  We run `prettier --check` as part of our test suite, and your contributions must pass.  Prettier is *very* opinionated and inflexible such that we cannot inject our own opinions.  There are no eslint/jshint files to manage in this project.
